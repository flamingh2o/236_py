# 236_py
The intent of this repository is to offer python code to aid in the analysation of data.  This analysis so far includes best fit lines with measurements that have physical meaning.
The creation of this code is for a physics lab, and it will have equations and examples to reflect this.

#The Equations
At this moment, the only available equation is a Lorentzian, or Cauchy, distribution.
Future plans include a double exponential decay, Gaussian distribution, and sech**2(x).
